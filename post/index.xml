      <description>My freshmen year at UT Austin I was unsure in the career I wanted to pursue. I started as a Public Health major and was on the Pre-Med track. It was the only career track I had interest at the time. It was until I became involved in the Freshmen Research Initiative program that made me realize what I wanted to pursue.
 Spring 2019 I was in the Big Data in Biology cohort and became exposed to Python and RNA-seq data analysis.</description>
